# Drumming Dummy

Drumming Dummy is a simple drum pad with four sounds. It was originally
released on http://zetacentauri.com and was downloaded more than 20,000
times before being open-sourced.

Clicking the button or typing the key for a drum sound will play 
that drum's audio.

For a more advanced drum pad application, see http://zetacentauri.com/software_drumpads.htm

To download the pre-built application, get this zip file:

If you'd like to use different sounds with the pre-built version, you'll need to
replace the existing sounds with files of the same name.

# Building

There is a Visual Studio project included. You'll also need to have the DirectX SDK
because the program depends on DirectMusic. And you'll probably have to set the
include and library paths in the Visual Studio project to match where you have
the DirectX SDK on your system.

# Development Status

I do not maintain this application and do not ever intend to update it.
